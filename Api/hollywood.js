                "description": "Top Gun Maverick box office day 1 collection: Tom Cruise's film collected $51 million at the US box office on its opening day. In India, it collected ₹4.75 crore. Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He’s nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago.Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one. In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.As per a Deadline report, Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%."

                "description": "In a video from the trial shared by Law & Crime Network on their YouTube channel, Amber told the jury, I am harassed, humiliated, threatened, every single day. Even just walking into this courtroom. Sitting here in front of the world, having the worst parts of my life, things that I have lived through, used to humiliate me. People want to kill me and they tell me so every day. People want to put my baby in the microwave, and they tell me that. She also said, I live my life with these sets of rules I've to follow, my friends have to follow for me not to have a panic attack or a triggering event or I relive the trauma, even from training to do. In my movie, for instance, for training for Aquaman, a combat scene and a trigger happen. I have a meltdown and have to deal with that, the crew I work with have to deal with that, because of the damage I walk around with every single day. I am not sitting in this courtroom snickering. I’m not sitting in this courtroom laughing, smiling, or making snide jokes. I’m not. This is horrible. A jury is scheduled to hear the closing arguments on Friday in Johnny's lawsuit against Amber. Each side will have two hours to summarise their case in a trial that has stretched on for six weeks. Johnny Depp is suing Amber for $50 million in Virginia's Fairfax County Circuit Court over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”. His lawyers say he was defamed by the article even though it never mentioned his name."
